Several solutions are possible, depending on the desired outcome:

1. **Avoid Percentages:**  If possible, avoid using percentages within the `calc()` function inside flex items. Use fixed units (px, em, rem) instead.

2. **Explicit Widths:** Define explicit widths (using pixels, ems, or rems) for the flex items. This gives you more control and prevents `calc()` from miscalculating based on percentage values within a flex context.

3. **Restructure the Layout:** Consider changing the layout structure to avoid the need for `calc()` with percentages within the flex container. This is an approach which would often need to be adopted based on the context.

4. **Alternative Calculation:** Use JavaScript to calculate the value instead of relying on CSS `calc()` when more control is needed.

**Example (bugSolution.css):**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  width: 200px; /* Explicit width instead of calc() */
  /* Other styles */
}
```

The specific solution will depend on the exact layout and desired behavior.
